# Pomodoro-Timer

Pomodoro timer method: "After each pomodoro (25-minute focus session), take a five-minute break from your work. And after completing four consecutive pomodoros, take a longer break, usually between 20 and 30 minutes."
For the demo's sake I considered a work interval of 3 min, each having 2 sec

- work interval buttton 
- short break button
- long break button

After each work interval one pomodoro fades out and the alarm gets started
